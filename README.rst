Computational Structural Biology Toolbox
========================================

CSB is a python library and application framework, which can be used
to solve problems in the field of structural bioinformatics. If
you are a bioinformatician, software engineer or a researcher working
in this field, chances are you may find something useful here. Our
package consists of a few major components:

1. Core class library - object-oriented, granular, with an emphasis
   on design and clean interfaces.

2. Application framework - console applications ("protocols"),
   which consume objects from the core library in order to build
   something executable (and hopefully useful).

3. Test framework - ensures that the library *actually* works.


Installation 
------------
CSB is being developed on Linux with Python 2.7 and 3.6. However, compatibility
is a design goal and the package works on any platform, on any modern Python
interpreter since version 2.6 (that includes python 3 support out of
the box). If you find any issues on a platform/interpreter different from
our development environment, please let us know.

CSB and all of its dependencies can be installed with pip::

    $ pip install csb

See http://csb-toolbox.github.io/Installation for more details.


Running CSB Applications
------------------------

CSB is bundled with a number of executable console csb.apps. Each app
provides a standard command line interface. To run any app, try::

    $ csb-app --help
    
where *csb-app* is the name of the application, such as ``csb-hhfrag``.
For more details on our app framework, including guidelines for writing new
applications, please refer to the API documentation, package "csb.apps".


Documentation
-------------

The project's web site at `GitHub <http://github.com/csb-toolbox>`_ contains
online documentation and samples. Visit us at:
    
http://csb-toolbox.github.io

Detailed API documentation can be found in the "docs/api" directory in the
distribution package (docs/api/index.html). This documentaiton is also hosted
on our web site:

https://csb-toolbox.github.io/api-docs/

Many packages contain introductory module level documentation and samples/tutorials.
These are also available in the HTML docs, but a quick way to access them is by using
the built-in python help system. For example, for a general introduction
see the module documentation of the root package::

    $ python -c "import csb; help(csb)"

If you are interested in a specific package, such as cs.bio.sequence,
try::    
    
    $ python -c "import csb.bio.sequence; help(csb.bio.sequence)"
